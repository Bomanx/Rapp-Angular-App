* Typescript (v2.9.2) - `npm install -g typescript` and make sure the `tsc` (typescript compiler) command works
* Bootstrap (Version 3) - on the [Bootstrap Website](http://getbootstrap.com/) go the v3.3.7 and download
* Angular 4 - commands to install can be seen at the [Angualr CLI Website](https://cli.angular.io/)
